        So now we've got our base theme set up, but you may want to go further. Tamagui
        lets you define two types of sub-themes.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="$5" theme="alt1">
        The main type of theme, like your base and accent themes, is one built out of a
        palette. It can be useful as a sub-theme for things like success, or error:
      </Paragraph>

      <StudioSuccess my="$3" title="Hello">
        <NoticeParagraph>
          This green section is using a sub-theme called <b>success</b> based on a green
          palette. It's great for notices, toasts, modals, badges, and more. Other useful
          sub-themes for states can be <b>error</b> or <b>alert</b>.
        </NoticeParagraph>
      </StudioSuccess>

      <Paragraph size="$5" theme="alt1">
        You can also create a different type of sub-theme, which is a bit more advanced.
        This is called a <b>mask</b> sub-theme. What it does it take a parent theme and
        "shift" the values it looks for in some way. These are useful for things like
        having an <b>active</b>, <b>disabled</b> or <b>dim</b> sub-theme.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="$5" theme="alt1">
        In the next step you can customize your sub-themes. We show a few recommended ones
        in the menu to help you get started.
