# Tamagui UI

<Description>
  A suite of OSS components for all&nbsp;React&nbsp;platforms.
</Description>

Each individual component includes installation instructions and can be installed independently, but you can also use all of the components via:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

## Setup

One thing to understand is that `tamagui` is a superset of `@tamagui/core`, so if you've already set up core, you'll want to actually replace every reference of "@tamagui/core" with "tamagui", including removing the core dependency altogether from your package.json.

When you replace everything with tamagui, you'll get a slightly more helpful TamaguiProvider that sets up a root portal for your various toasts, dialogs, and modals which you'll need to add to the highest point in your app, replacing the core provider if you use it already:

```tsx
import { TamaguiProvider, View } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <TamaguiProvider config={yourConfig}>
    <View />
  </TamaguiProvider>
)
```

Other than that, there's a large amount of optional configuration through `createTamagui` that is [documented in the Core Installation docs](/docs/intro/installation).

You are all set!
