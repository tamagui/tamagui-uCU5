### Warning 001

#### Ignorable modules

This error means the compiler can't bundle some dependencies into what it reads
at compile-time in order to optimize. It's not necessarily an error and usually
won't de-opt.

To see a full stack trace set:

```bash
DEBUG=tamagui
```

To disable the warning you can set:

```bash
TAMAGUI_IGNORE_BUNDLE_ERRORS=some_module_name,some_other_module_name
# Or to disable them all (not recommended):
TAMAGUI_IGNORE_BUNDLE_ERRORS=true
```

### Warning 002

You're rendering a Tamagui <Adapt /> component without nesting it inside a parent that is able to adapt.
